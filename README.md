# README

Welcome to my first RoR App,

I created this project during my internship at Translation.io (https://translation.io)

This code is my first experience with React and Ruby on rails, I didnt tried to do a beautiful app, I just wanted to learn how to use React and RoR, so dont be too hard on me :)

Thanks for your attention, Benjamin :)
